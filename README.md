# Pac-Man-Factory
This is a program that utilizes html and js to produce a Pac-Man sprite at the click of a button!
Go ahead and fork and clone this repo to your machine to see it in action!
<h2> Future Roadmap </h2>
<p> As I continue to work on this there are a few improvements I'd like to make. As you will notice the Pac-Man image is stagnant, meaning that it isnt quite animated. I'd like to continue to work on my coding skills and get to a point where I can make use of all the images uploaded to this repo to make the Pac-Man sprites animated! </p>
